A common definition of terrorim is the systematic or threatened of violence to intimidate a population or government for political, religious, or ideological goals.

**Goals of this Project :**
- To conduct Exploratory data Analysis, supported by appropriate viusals, to find out the hot zones of terrorim in Nigeria.
- To develop a good performing model, in order to predict if a potential terrorist attack would be successful or not.
- To Build a dash app to allow users interact with the outcome of this projects.

**Source of Data :**
For this project, the [Global Terrorism Database(GTD)]("www.start.umd.edu/gtd/"), a database of terrorist incidents from 1970 up to 2020(Although some years was excluded), was used. The dataset can be downloaded in preferred format from www.start.umd.edu/gtd/
